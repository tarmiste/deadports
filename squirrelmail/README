README for squirrelmail 1.4.x

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
Export variable containing htdocs root directory (I prefer srv/www/apache/htdocs):

  export SQM_HTDOCS_ROOT="srv/www/apache/htdocs"

It will be used inside Pkgfile, so footprint will probably give you an error.
All README and INSTALL files were deleted, look at the source tarball for them.

POST-INSTALL
(from INSTALL)
- Select a data-dir and attachment dir, outside the webtree (e.g. in /var).
  The data-dir (for user prefs) should be owned by the user the webserver runs
  as (e.g. www-data). The attachment dir (for uploading files as  attachments)
  should be file mode 0730 and in the same group as the webserver.
- Run config/conf.pl from the command line. Use the D option to load predefined
  options for specific IMAP servers, and edit at least the Server Settings and
  General Options (datadir).
- Browse to http://www.example.com/yourwebmaillocation/src/configtest.php to
  test your configuration for common errors.
