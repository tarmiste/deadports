README for nwn-diamond


REQUIREMENTS:

A 'games' group is required for NWN installation. Ideally, your user
needs to be a member of the games group to play NWN. The 'pre-install'
script will create it for you if run.


PRECAUTION:

Unlike the nwn port, this port installs the shared data files from the
Diamond Edition DVD and requires you to have it and that it be mounted
during the pkgmk process. By default, the Pkgfile looks for it to be
mounted at /mnt/dvd. If your cdrom/dvd mount point is other than this,
use the CDROM_LOCATION environment variable to specify the correct
location like so:

	# env CDROM_LOCATION=/media/dvd pkgmk -d -i

CD keys for NWN, NWN:SoU, and NWN:HotU are still required to play the
game. The game will ask for them the first time it's run.
