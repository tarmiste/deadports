POST-INSTALL

1. The airmon-ng tool included in aircrack-ng requires 'iw' to be installed.
   Otherwise they will just abort with an error saying:
     ERROR: Neither the sysfs interface links nor the iw command is available.
     Please download and install iw from http://dl.aircrack-ng.org/iw.tar.bz2

   So, you can safely install 'iw' from contrib ports by doing:
   # ports -u contrib; prt-get install iw
