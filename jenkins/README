        noexec and /tmp troubleshooting
        -------------------------------

        Many simple exploits that are used against servers rely upon being able
        to execute commands in /tmp. As a security precaution, /tmp is mounted
        with noexec. This is a good thing and should generally stay this way,
        but jenkins doesn't think so, and it will give an error like:
        "UnsatisfiedLinkError: ... failed to map segment from shared object".

        In this situation, we need to edit file /usr/etc/jenkins.conf and add
        "-Djava.io.tmpdir=/your/chrooted/tmp" into JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS variable.
