POST-INSTALL

  eAccelerator can be installed both as Zend or PHP extension.
  When you install eAccelerator as a zend_extension you need to give the 
  full path to the eaccelerator.so library.

  Edit your php.ini file (usually /etc/php.ini)

  To install as Zend extension:

    zend_extension = "/usr/lib/php/extensions/eaccelerator.so"
    eaccelerator.shm_size = 0
    eaccelerator.cache_dir = "/tmp/eaccelerator"
    eaccelerator.enable = 1
    eaccelerator.optimizer = 1
    eaccelerator.check_mtime = 1
    eaccelerator.debugi = 0
    eaccelerator.filter = ""
    eaccelerator.shm_max = 0
    eaccelerator.shm_ttl = 3600
    eaccelerator.shm_prune_period = 0
    eaccelerator.shm_only = 0
    eaccelerator.compress = 1
    eaccelerator.compress_level = 9
    eaccelerator.sessions = "shm_and_disk"
    eaccelerator.content = "shm_and_disk"


  If you use a thread safe build of PHP you must use 
  "zend_extension_ts" instead of "zend_extension".

  To install as PHP extension:
  
    extension="eaccelerator.so"
    eaccelerator.shm_size = 0
    eaccelerator.cache_dir = "/tmp/eaccelerator"
    eaccelerator.enable = 1
    eaccelerator.optimizer = 1
    eaccelerator.check_mtime = 1
    eaccelerator.debugi = 0
    eaccelerator.filter = ""
    eaccelerator.shm_max = 0
    eaccelerator.shm_ttl = 3600
    eaccelerator.shm_prune_period = 0
    eaccelerator.shm_only = 0
    eaccelerator.compress = 1
    eaccelerator.compress_level = 9
    eaccelerator.sessions = "shm_and_disk"
    eaccelerator.content = "shm_and_disk"

  
  
  One last very important step is creating the cache directory that you 
  configured in the previous step. The default value is /tmp/eaccelerator
  It's easy because it's writable to everyone, but it isn't very smart
  because on a lot of systems this directory is cleaned on reboot.
  A better place would be /var/cache/eaccelerator.
  
  Create the directory and make sure it's writable for the user
  eAccelerator runs under (usually the user which you webserver runs as).
  
  A safe bet is making it world writable. A safer and cleaner way would be to
  change the owner of the directory to the same user PHP runs as (most of the
  time the same user as Apache or Lighttpd) and set 0644 permissions.

  The lazy way:
  
    mkdir /tmp/eaccelerator
    chmod 0777 /tmp/eaccelerator
