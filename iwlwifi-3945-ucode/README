NOTES


*** Note for kernel >= 2.6.29 ***

  Check that you enabled the following config options in the kernel:
  
  * CFG80211=m
  * MAC80211=m
  * WLAN_80211=y
  * IWLWIFI=y
  * IWL3945=m

  The iwlwifi-3945 driver will look for the file iwlwifi-3945-2.ucode using the
  kernel's firmware_loader infrastructure.  In order to function correctly, you
  need to have this support enabled in your kernel.  When you configure the
  kernel, you can find this option in the following location:

  Device Drivers ->
  	Generic Driver Options ->
        	Hotplug firmware loading support
