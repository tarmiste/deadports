    1. Add '/usr/lib/ladspa' to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    2. Add the following to your ALSA configuration file:

    /etc/asound.conf
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ctl.equal {
        type equal;
    }

    pcm.plugequal {
        type equal;

        # Modify the line below if you do not want to use sound card 0.
        #slave.pcm "plughw:0,0";

        # by default we want to play from more sources at time:
        slave.pcm "plug:dmix";
    }

    # pcm.equal {
    # If you do not want the equalizer to be your default soundcard
    # comment the following line and uncomment the above line.
    # (You can choose it as the output device by addressing it with specific
    #  apps,eg mpg123 -a equal 06.Back_In_Black.mp3)
    pcm.!default {
        type plug;
        slave.pcm plugequal;
    }
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And you are ready to change your equalizer using command
    $ alsamixer -D equal

    Note that configuration file is different for each user (until not
    specified else) it is saved in ~/.alsaequal.bin. So if you want to use
    ALSAEqual with mpd or another software running under different user, you
    can configure it using

    $ su mpd -c 'alsamixer -D equal'

    or for example, you can make a symlink to your .alsaequal.bin in his home.
