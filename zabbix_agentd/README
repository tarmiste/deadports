README for zabbix agent daemon

REQUIREMENTS

PRE-INSTALL
This port include zabbix_agentd. For other apps see my zabbix_utils port.

POST-INSTALL
1. Change Hostname, ListenIP and Server in /etc/zabbix_agentd.conf to
something useful.

2. On the client (monitored) machines, you may add the following lines to
 /etc/services:
  zabbix_agent 10050/tcp
  zabbix_trap 10051/tcp

3. Run post-install to create dedicated user for the agent instead of 'daemon'.

PRECAUTION
Starting from version 1.6.3 linux agent suppports 'iowait', 'interrupt',
'softirq' and 'steal' for 'system.cpu.util' out of the box. The patch is no
longer provided.

After upgrading from version 1.6.4 log default file location was changed,
adjust /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf file:
 LogFile=/var/log/zabbix_agentd/zabbix_agentd.log
and change it's permissions, and possibly delete old log dir.
