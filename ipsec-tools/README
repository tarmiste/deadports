README for ipsec-tools

REQUIREMENTS
For ipv4 IPSEC you'll need to enable:
  CONFIG_XFRM_USER
  CONFIG_NET_KEY
  CONFIG_INET_AH
  CONFIG_INET_ESP
  CONFIG_INET_XFRM_MODE_TRANSPORT
  CONFIG_INET_XFRM_MODE_TUNNEL

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

RESOURCES

PRECAUTION
This is a very important piece of software, test your configuration
(try to capture/analyze some data) before production use.

Both transport and tunnel mode was tested for ipv4, but I am unsure if
automatic keying will work out of the box - no rc file for racoon is
provided for now. Any suggestions on template configurations from
people who use racoon in real life are welcome.
