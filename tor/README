README for tor

PRECAUTION

    Make sure you edit /etc/pkgadd.conf and add the following lines:

    UPGRADE         ^var/lib/tor/.*$            NO
    UPGRADE         ^etc/tor/torrc$             NO
    UPGRADE         ^etc/tor/torifyrc$          NO

    Failure to do so will result in the loss of your tor data and
    configuration upon update!

    If you edit the torrc file for extra logging, make sure you:
    chmod 0640 /var/log/tor/* files, for security reasons.

PRE-INSTALL

    Tor expects to have a user and group dedicated to it.
    pre-install script takes care of this.

NOTES

    DNS
    ---

    If you want to use Tor DNS as default nameserver on port 53,
    dont forget to allow non-root process to bind a privileged port:

    sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/tor
